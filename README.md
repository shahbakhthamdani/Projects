# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction

This repository consists of  projects that I worked on as part of University of California, Berkeley's MIDS (Master of Information and Data Science) program.

Some of these were individual, but most were group based. These projects cover a range of topics such as Objected-Oriented Programming (OOP), data exploration and analysis, data cleaning, statistical inference and experiment design, predictive analytics and computer vision.

All the high-level results can be found in `README.md` pages of individual projects, and project report plus underlying code is available within the folder.
