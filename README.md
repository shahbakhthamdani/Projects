# Data Science Portfolio

## Introduction

This repository consists of  projects that I worked on as part of University of California, Berkeley's MIDS (Master of Information and Data Science) program.

Some of these were individual, but most were group based. These projects cover a range of topics such as Objected-Oriented Programming (OOP), data exploration and analysis, data cleaning, statistical inference and experiment design, predictive analytics and computer vision.

All the high-level results can be found in `README.md` pages of individual projects, and project report plus underlying code is available within the folder.

### Data Science Projects

- **Sentiment Analysis and Time Series Analysis**: Using sentiment analysis of tweets to predict specific stocks' performance, based on historic data.
- **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis**: Exploring MIT's Observatory of Economic Complexity Data for long-term EU Trade trends.
- **Statistical Inference and Exploratory Analysis**: Conducting causality and regression analysis of crime stats for North Carolina.
- **Experiment Design and Statistical Inference**: Designing experiment, collecting data and conducting statistical inference to determine causal relationship between stress and watching "stress reducing" clips.
- **Predictive Analytics**:
  - Determining the click-through rate on a large set of online advertising data using classification techniques.
  - Determining *bot* activity on an auction to delineate which bids were made by humans versus which bids were made by bots.

### Python Projects

- **Objected Oriented Programming**: A simplified version of *Texas Hold 'Em* implemented completely in Python using classes and functions.
