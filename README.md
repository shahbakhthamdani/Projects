## Introduction

This repository contains data science and machine learning projects that I worked on as part of **University of California, Berkeley's MIDS (The Master of Information and Data Science)** program.

Link to [MIDS Homepage](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/).

These projects cover a range of topics such as:

- Objected-Oriented Programming (OOP),
- data gathering, cleaning, exploration and analysis (EDA),
- statistical inference and experiment design,
- predictive analytics,
- computer vision.

All high-level results and summaries can be found in `README.md` pages of individual project folders, along with full reports and underlying code.

Please use the *table of contents* below for quick navigation.
