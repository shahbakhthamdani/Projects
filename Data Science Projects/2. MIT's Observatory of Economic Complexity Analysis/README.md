## 1. Overview

For this project, we chose to explore MIT’s Observatory of Economic Complexity (“OEC”), a
database which gathers product trade data, e.g. imports and exports of goods, by country for
each year. The data is presented in absolute value of trades and divided by the products that
were traded, further sliced into years.

From this data, we were aiming to look at some long-time trends that could be deciphered from
ebb and flow of imports and exports in the European region, particularly in the light of major
diplomatic and economic integration such as formation of European Monetary Union.
